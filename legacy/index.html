          <strong>Description: </strong>A simple farming game written in
          JavaScript, centered around continuous design requirements and
          continuous integration. This project was done to achieve the 
          following challenges: Storing states of cells in a single 
          continuous byte array, creating an installable link on mobile,
          allowing offline usage, localization options, internationalization 
          practices, and writing both an external and internal DSL, allowing 
          for the design to be easily scalable and accessible.

          <strong>Description: </strong>A web application made in TypeScript,
          consisting of a leaflet map, initially anchored to the UCSC campus,
          filled with geocaches that generate around the player, centered around
          the flyweight pattern, memento pattern, and continuous integration. 
          The utilization of the flyweight pattern helped preseve a level of cache 
          data efficiently, reinforcing good memory handling practices. The use of the 
          memento pattern helped in optimizing how data was stored and accessed, allowing 
          geocaches to seamlessly load in data, remembering the impact made from users.
